### Ex-4.2

### Use of Serverless functions:

User logs into the app, a serverless function can be triggered to authenticate their credentials and generate an access token in an authorization server. This function can be hosted on AWS Lambda(Cloud platform)

Built-in services make it easy to develop and deploy your app, so you don’t need to implement it from scratch.

the pricing model of serverless services is somewhat interesting. The cost is execution-based, meaning that you’re charged for the execution time, unlike the 24/7 server maintaining cost of traditional architectures.
